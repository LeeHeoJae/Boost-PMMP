***BattleGround*s EnergyDrink for MCBE**  
**This plugin uses starvation as energy**
*So you can't use starvation system.*

### Way to calculation
~~I will call full energy 20E and full hp 20H~~  
When you have more than 15E, you get 1.5H per seconds.
When you have more than 6E, you get 1.0H per seconds.
When you have more than 1E, you get 0.5H per seconds.

You consume 1E every 4 seconds.
You can get same energy when you eat food.
